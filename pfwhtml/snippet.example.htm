<h1>Framework-generated page</h1>
<p>
    This is an example page, generated through the framework. As you will notice, it is correct and compressed HTML5.
</p>
<p>
    Try visiting a <a href="nonexistpage">page that doesn't exist</a> to see an error page or navigate to a 
    <a href="home">page that actually exists</a> - notice how the URL corresponds directly to the name of the
    imported module.
