	Hello World. This page was created with a very simple and extenible python framework.
	The framework works by letting a user dynamically add modules. Each module will then
	generate some html (in some way) and return it back to the controller. The controller
	wraps this in valid HTML5 and then prints it. It's really simple --- but it works!
